# BITS_Pilani-Undergraduate-Thesis
Python code for mesh recombination (conversion of a pure tri mesh to a hybrid/pure quad mesh). Includes various `.vol` files, which are mesh file formats and are read using Netgen/NGsolve. 
Done as a part of my Undergraduate Thesis for BITS Pilani @ IISc, Bangalore.
